-add a power system to the ships //done except for power storage
-add a cpu cap for the ships //done
-add a power generator pixel to the ships //done
-add a CommandModule pixel to the ships (it will provide cpu cap) //done
-add a functionality to deactivate/activate ship systems // done
-make an actual UI and the ability to stop shooting/stop your ship // stopping your ship done
-make an AI for enemy/friendly ships  //done
-make simple graphics for different pixels instead of just having them be different colors
-make ships more maneuverable at max speed
-right now destroying all power generators on a ship calls OnDestroyCommandModule() and it should do something different, implement that
-change the equation for the velocity of a pixel that's been destroyed so that it looks cooler

(Report a bug to unity - if you compare an object to null using its interface, it doesnt return null even tho it was destroyed)
